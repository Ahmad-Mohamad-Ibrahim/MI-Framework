1. Arguments should be taken up to the '/'
    (for example /user/{id} should match this => /user/1, but not this /user/1/2)
2. Database
3. Model
4. Session Management
5. Add twig engine


important : the template engine code needs some error handling

Issues
1. this url = /user/1/comment/4 
matches both :
    /user/{userId}/comment/{commentId} ok
    /user/{id} shouldn't match this
(Fixed)

2. Implementing a templating engine
    a. I need some way to be able to change between template engines

    An idea is a (ViewFactory) to create the view and maybe output the response

    note that the options for TWIG aren't the whole options
